# Task 1 (Conditional flow)

## Question 1

Great code with a enclosed in a nice function with a great if/else loop to ensure the input is valid.

5/5

## Question 2

Nicely identified all 4 errors, nicely done! Minor but it should probably be greater than or equal to.

3/4

## Question 3

This is great!! I wouldn't say it's the most elegant but it's definitely well separated out and readable! You check your inputs and print out accordingly. My one minor issue is it'll break if the user input can't be converted into an int, there might be a better way of checking that. Other than that it's a nice snippet of code. Loved that you spotted an issue with the question too.

# Task 2 (Lists and Dictionaries)

## Question 1

Nice a simple but good base knowledge.

2/2

## Question 2

Nice code! Good bit of string formatting too! Try using `lower` to ensure the user input matches regardless of case, this works great for an input of `milk` but not `Milk` or `MILK`. Also you might want to catch an invalid key.

3/5

## Question 3

This is awesome! It would've been nice if you didn't fix the lottery numbers but that's very minor. You use some great functions here `sample` and `intersection` are great choices. Great string formatting and if loops (although they could be elif's). Great code.

# Task 3 (Read and Write files)

## Question 1

Great answer, I'm glad you find the additional modules exciting! Me too!
2/2

## Question 2

Nice easy fix
2/2

## Question 3

1. Write the lyrics to a new file called song.txt
2. Check that a file has been created successfully.
3. Read lines from this file and print out ONLY those lines that have the word ‘still’ in them.

3.1 - Lyrics written to file - done
3.2 - Nice check and exception catching - done - although it's an odd way of checking a file exists, what happens if it doesn't? The code will error.
3.3 - 5 lines printed to terminal (I thought there'd be more ... weird!) - done - I'm glad you added the second approach, we want to count all still's.

Well done! It's literally the file check that let you down a little, but's it's a tricky one.

# Task 4 (API)

## Question 1

Awesome as always, nice f-strings in the request call, great list comprehension to obtain the move and parameterised endpoint.

10/10

## Question 2

Amazing again, simple questions but shows you understand all the aspects.

5/5
