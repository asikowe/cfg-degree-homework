1.1 - 1 - Great definitions and benefits of Python!

1.2 - 1 - Counts returns the number of times a string occurs in another string, slight wording difference but I understood and your example shows it brilliantly.

2 - 3 - An efficient and clean solution with a great use of list comprehension. My only issues is it unfortunately doesn't work! You could've had something like this: print(len([c for c in text if c.isupper()])). Great idea though.

3 - 7 - A clean efficient solution. Minimal fuss just a nice reverse slice.

4 - 8 - Amazing!! I've never used or seen the key argument for the max function before! I've learnt something new and that's a VERY neat solution.

5 - 19 - Amazing calculator, you've broken the code down nicely into management chunks. It would've been nice to see some nicely formatted f or .format strings given the amount of numbers and print statements.

7.B - 5 - Great query, with a great use of aliasing to reduce the repeat calculations.

7.C - 5

7.D - 5 - Great knowledge of indexes in MySQL, all these options would increase the performance for specific queries. Brilliant uses of examples too, it really hammers home what you're describing.

8 - 10 - Great use of aliasing to avoid confusing between tables. You've understood joins and know how to use that with an aggregator function like AVG too!

9 - 9 - Good table and use of different types, I'd like to see some NOT NULLs or constraints.

Overall - 92 - Outstanding! Only a few marks dropped across the entire assessment. Your base knowledge is exceptional! Keep it up.
