### Question 2 (Yoga Booking System)

Good answer and breakdown of the various workstreams. I'm not sure how easy some of these descriptions are to pick up and run with. Additionally I'm not sure what the "Server" features are, typically you have a database accessed via an API which has some endpoints for the UI to hit and obtain/dump data. There will be infrastructure to sort out but that's typically how and where it's hosted. There's also a lot here and there's aspects that might be out of scope for an initial prototype in 2 weeks so you might want to think how to scale this back, maybe really simplify accounts or remove the need for passwords.

### Question 1 (Cinema Booking System)

Great answer! Your requirements and considerations and you've got the big hitters in terms of potential problems, mainly a payment system and buggy/laggy UI/backend. It'd be good to get an idea of the tools you'd use for this too? We've got an API and DB but what tools are we thinking? MySQL and Flask or something else?
