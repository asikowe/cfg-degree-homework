## SQL

### 1.1.1 - single column

Amazing definition and nice generic example too with the inclusion of multiple single column indexes too!
5/5

### 1.1.2 - multi column

It's one that's been raised amongst the instructors and we're giving this for this definition (multiple single indexes) and a duplicate of the composite.
5/5

### 1.1.3 - Composite

Good example but the definition is lacking a little and missing a bits about the potential downsides. Say I definite a composite with (col1, col2, col3) I can query col1 with the same benefit as col1 + col2 and col1 + col2 + col3 but a standalone query for col2 or col3 won't. Order matters.
4/5

### 1.1.4 - Clustered

Great definition and knowledge the MySQL automatically uses the PRIMARY KEY. Great example use case too.
5/5

### 1.2

Makes sense to me, it's hard to give a real reason without a use case but your explanation makes sense to me, this could be used as a reference table and just query for ID/name but it could also just pull out name/price, either way your example works!
5/5

### 1.3

Amazing! You're explanation of why name and why last name first is great!
5/5
