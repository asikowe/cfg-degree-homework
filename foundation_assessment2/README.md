### 1. Python theory questions (20)

1.1 - 1/2 - instructions written in a programming language.
1.2 - 1/2 - a process is typically one thread but can be multithreaded too.
1.3 - 2/2
1.4 - 2/2
1.5 - 1/2 - the python interpreter uses a GIL.
1.6 - 2/2
1.7 - 2/2
1.8 - 2/2
1.9 - 2/2 - great knowledge of deadlock and livelock situations
1.10 - 2/2

### 2. Python 2 and Python 3 (8)

The number and details of the differences more than meets the criteria. Key aspects that were expected for full marks include the maintenance of python 2/3 (with python 2 being at the end of life) and python 2 libraries are frozen beyond bug fixes. I would say it is possible to port from python 3 to 2 (there's a `future` library that could be utilised).

6/8

### 3. Palindrome (8)

Smashed it. Nice simple, elegant solution.

8/8

### 4. Palindrome Tests (8)

Nice tests for pass and failure cases! Nice use of `__name__ == '__main__'` too, works a treat!

8/8

### 5. Agile (8)

Great understanding of different agile meetings. Three definitions needed and you nailed it.

8/8

### 6. Exception Handling (8)

Great definitions and understanding of the try/except block keywords.

8/8

### 7. Python and Databases (8)

Great knowledge of the MySQL connector and how to implement it. For full marks the concept of using an "engine" to connect to a database was needed (generalising the connection).

7/8

### 8. SQL practical question (10)

Smashed it, mark scheme has the sum of book totals in the select but the question implies only the author names is needed so I'm in complete agreement that's all that should be returned, particularly if there's 1M+ rows, keep the select as small as possible. Everything else is the absolute textbook right answer. I like the inclusion of the `HAVING` to ensure your returning good data!

10/10

### 9. Two Number Sum (22)

This is AWESOME! This does exactly what the question asked. It returns the results I expect and when you get down to the logic it's nice and succinct. Even the edge cases of multiple answers for obtaining the target are covered here! Great code. Really minor point but I try to only use strings as dictionary keys, weird things happen and this could allow floats which going ultra weird as keys.
